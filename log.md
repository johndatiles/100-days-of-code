# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Progress Being Tracked on Twitter - Learning in Public!

### Day 3: December 3, 2020
#### Debugging

**Progress and Thoughts** Went through a short lesson on debuggings code errors, both syntax and logic. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong 

### Day 2: December 2, 2020
#### A first splash into JavaScript 

**Progress and Thoughts** Started the mozilla MDN learning area, which walked me through building a number guessing game with JavaScript. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash. Found it to be a good resource and introduction to JavaScript.

Discovered the Advent of Code December challenge. Neat! Didn't attempt solving the Day 1 puzzle, but looked at other JavaScript solutions, interesting to see how people think thru code.
### Day 1: December 1, 2020
##### Starting this challenge to learn the Gatsby.js framework and build a personal website.

**Today's Progress:** Forked and cloned this repo. Continued slightly customizing the gatsby-starter-lumen boilerplate.

**Thoughts:** First day of this challenge, though I've been fiddling around with code off and on for the past couple of weeks. Finding solutions as problems/issues present themselves, mostly through google/stackoverflow. Not sure this is efficient. Need to go through the rest of the Gatsby.js tutorials.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
