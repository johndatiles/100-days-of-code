# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 1, 2020 (Example 1)
##### Starting this challenge to learn the Gatsby.js framework and build a personal website.

**Today's Progress:** Forked and cloned this repo. Continued slightly customizing the gatsby-starter-lumen boilerplate.

**Thoughts:** First day of this challenge, though I've been fiddling around with code off and on for the past couple of weeks. Finding solutions as problems/issues present themselves, mostly through google/stackoverflow. Not sure this is efficient. Need to go through the rest of the Gatsby.js tutorials.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
